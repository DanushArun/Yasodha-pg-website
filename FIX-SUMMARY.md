# Mobile Issues Fixed

## 1. Mobile Menu Fixed
- Added `!important` declarations to ensure nav-toggle displays on mobile
- Fixed nav-links positioning and display properties
- Enhanced hamburger menu visibility with proper styling
- Added cursor pointer and z-index for better interaction

## 2. Stats Section Removed
- Removed the dynamic stats section (1000+ Happy Residents, 24/7 Security, etc.)
- Cleaned up JavaScript code in `interactive.js`
- Removed associated CSS styles for stats section
- The function `initCounterAnimations()` now does nothing to avoid breaking calls

## 3. Gallery Arrows Fixed
- Added proper styling for gallery navigation arrows
- Arrows now have:
  - White background with shadow
  - 50px size for better touch targets
  - Hover effects with scale and color change
  - Proper positioning (20px from edges)
  - Font weight 700 for better visibility

## 4. Gallery Watermark Added
- Added instruction text below "A visual tour of Yasodha Residency"
- Text says: "Tap on any image to view full screen"
- Includes a hand pointer icon
- Styled with italic, smaller font, and subtle color

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix mobile menu, remove stats section, fix gallery arrows, add gallery instruction"
